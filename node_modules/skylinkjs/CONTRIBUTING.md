## Committing to the Temasys Web SDK branch

For developers who wants to contribute to the source code, you would require to fork your own repostiory and create a pull-request to a new branch.

Branch name format: `#< TICK_NO >-FEATURE_NAME`.

For example, if I'm fixing a bug for safari's video stream, I'll have a branch name called `#12-bugfix-safari-video`. If there is any tickets relating to the feature, do put a ticket for it.

Alternatively, you may just simply have your branch name `FEATURE_NAME` if this is for improvements to the code structure. But it is usually recommended to open a new ticket in github, linking the branch to the ticket number and pushing it.

All pull-requests requires a descripttion on what changes are made.

Please pull-request to `0.6.x/development` branch as it will assist in easier development.

Ensure that `publish/` and `doc/` files are not commited in the pull-request. These are files required for commiting only for releases.
